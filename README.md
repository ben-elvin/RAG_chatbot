# RAG Chatbot Project

Welcome to my RAG Chatbot Project repository! I created this project to teach students about large language models (LLMs) through hands-on experience in building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. By utilising open-source models from Hugging Face, LangChain, and Streamlit, students will gain practical knowledge and skills in creating advanced conversational AI.

## About the Project

The RAG Chatbot Project was designed specifically for students at WBS Coding School. It's a comprehensive learning tool where students are encouraged to explore, experiment, and eventually create their own specialised chatbots. This project showcases the capabilities of modern LLMs and demonstrates how to leverage them for building sophisticated applications.

## Key Features

- **Hands-On Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks guide students through the process of building a RAG chatbot. These notebooks are designed to be run locally or on Google Colab. If using Colab, students might notice a local tunnel in the Streamlit notebook, which helps run the Streamlit app. This can be ignored if working locally.
- **Open Source Tools**: Utilises popular open-source libraries and frameworks such as:
  - **Hugging Face**: For accessing pre-trained LLMs and other NLP tools.
  - **LangChain**: For managing the complex logic of language models and their interactions.
  - **Streamlit**: For creating a user-friendly interface for the chatbot.
- **Learning Objectives**: Gain a deep understanding of:
  - The history and evolution of large language models.
  - Fundamentals of deep learning.
  - Working with vector databases and their importance in modern AI applications.

## Learning Platform

While the interactive notebooks are a core component of this project, they are complemented by a comprehensive learning platform. This platform provides detailed information and resources on various topics such as the history of LLMs, deep learning principles, and vector databases. Note that the learning platform itself is not included in this repository but serves as an essential companion to the hands-on exercises.

## Encouraging Innovation

At WBS Coding School, students are not just passive learners but active creators. This project encourages students to take the foundational knowledge and skills gained here and innovate. Build a specialised chatbot tailored to unique applications or industries, leveraging the power of what has been learned.
