# RAG Chatbot Project

Welcome to the RAG Chatbot Project repository! I created this project to help students learn about large language models (LLMs) through hands-on experience in building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. By using open-source models from Hugging Face, LangChain, and Streamlit, you'll gain practical knowledge and skills in developing advanced conversational AI systems.

## About the Project

I designed the RAG Chatbot Project specifically for students at WBS Coding School. This comprehensive learning tool encourages you to explore, experiment, and ultimately create your own specialised chatbots. The project showcases the capabilities of modern LLMs and demonstrates how to leverage them to build sophisticated applications.

## Key Features

- **Hands-On Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks guide you through the process of building a RAG chatbot. These notebooks are intended to be run locally or on Google Colab. If you use Colab, you might encounter a local tunnel in the Streamlit notebook, which helps run the Streamlit app; this can be ignored if working locally.
- **Open Source Tools**: Utilises popular open-source libraries and frameworks such as:
  - **Hugging Face**: Provides access to pre-trained LLMs and other NLP tools.
  - **LangChain**: Manages the complex logic of language models and their interactions.
  - **Streamlit**: Creates a user-friendly interface for the chatbot.
- **Learning Objectives**: Develop a deep understanding of:
  - The history and evolution of large language models.
  - Fundamentals of deep learning.
  - Working with vector databases and their significance in modern AI applications.

## Learning Platform

The interactive notebooks in this repository are complemented by a comprehensive learning platform. This platform offers detailed information and resources on various topics, including the history of LLMs, deep learning principles, and vector databases. Please note that the learning platform itself is not included in this repository but is an essential companion to the hands-on exercises.

## Encouraging Innovation

At WBS Coding School, we encourage students to be active creators rather than passive learners. This project is designed to inspire you to take the foundational knowledge and skills you've gained and innovate. Use what you've learned to build a specialised chatbot tailored to unique applications or industries.

Happy building, and enjoy your journey into the world of conversational AI!
